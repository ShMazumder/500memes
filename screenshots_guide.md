# 📸 Play Store Screenshots Guide

Here is everything you need to create the screenshots for your Google Play Store listing.

## 1. Screenshot Captions (Text to overlay)
Add these short, punchy texts to your screenshots to increase downloads.

**Screenshot 1 (Main Feed)**

## 2. How to Take Screenshots

Since the app is built with Flutter, you can easily take high-quality screenshots.

### Option A: Using Flutter Command (Best Quality)
1.  **Run the app** on your emulator or connected device:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
2.  **Take a screenshot** by creating a new terminal tab (keep the app running) and typing:
    ```bash
    flutter screenshot
    ```
    This saves a screenshot file (e.g., `flutter_01.png`) in your project root.

### Option B: Using Android Emulator
1.  Run the app in the Android Emulator.
2.  Click the **Camera icon** 📷 in the emulator toolbar (usually on the right).
3.  The image is saved to your desktop or pictures folder.

### Option C: On a Real Device
1.  Run the app on your phone.
2.  Press **Power + Volume Down** (standard Android combo).

## 3. Pro Tip: Device Mockups
To make your screenshots look professional (like the ones with the phone frame around them):
1.  Take the raw screenshots using **Option A**.
2.  Use a free tool like **[AppMockup](https://app-mockup.com/)** or **[Previewed](https://previewed.app/)**.
3.  Upload your screenshots and type the **Captions** from Section 1 above.
